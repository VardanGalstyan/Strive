/*  
    JS Basics
      A) Create a variable called "test" and assign a string to it.
      B) Create a variable called "sum" and assign to it the result of the sum between 10 and 20.
      C) Create a variable called "random" and assign to it a random number between 0 and 20 (it should be randomly created at each execution).
      D) Create a variable called "me" and assign to it an object containing the following information: name = your name, surname = your surname, age = your age.
      E) Programmatically remove the age property from the previously create object.
      F) Programmatically add to the object me an array called "skills", containing the programming languages you know right now.
      G)  Programmatically remove the last skill from the "skills" array inside the "me" object.

    JS Functions
      Ex. 1 Write a function called "dice"; it should randomize an integer number between 1 and 6.
      Ex. 2 Write a function called "whoIsBigger" which receives 2 numbers as parameters and returns the biggest one.
      Ex. 3 Write a function called "splitMe" which receives a string as a parameter and returns an array with every word in that string.
      Ex. 4 Write a function called "deleteOne" which receives a string and a boolean as parameters. If the boolean value is true it should return the string without the first letter, otherwise it should remove the last one from it.
      Ex. 5 Write a function called "onlyLetters" which receives a string as a parameter and returns it removing all the digits.
      Ex. 6 Write a function called "isThisAnEmail" which receives a string as a parameter and returns true if the string is a valid email address.
      Ex. 7 Write a function called "whatDayIsIt" that should return the current day of the week.
      Ex. 8 Write a function called "rollTheDices" which receives a number as a parameter. It should invoke the dice() function defined in Ex1 the specified amount of times, and return an object containing a "sum" property holding the sum of all values extracted and a "values" array containing the single values of the dicerolls themselves.
      Ex. 9 Write a function called "howManyDays" which receives a date as a parameter and should return the number of days passed since that date.
      Ex. 10 Write a function called "isTodayMyBirthday" which should return true if today's your birthday, false otherwise.

      Ex. 13 Write a function called "countMovies" which returns the number of movies contained in the array provided at the end of this file.
      Ex. 14 Write a function called "onlyTheTitles" which creates an array with just the titles of the movies provided in the array at the end of the file.
      Ex. 15 Write a function called "onlyInThisMillennium" which returns only the movies produced in this millennium.
      Ex. 16 Write a function called "getMovieById" which receives an id as a parameter and returns the movie with the given id.

      Ex. 18 Write a function called "searchByTitle" which receives a string as a parameter and returns all the movies which contain that string in the title.
      Ex. 19 Write a function called "searchAndDivide" which receives a string as a parameter and returns an object; this object should contain an array called "match", made by all the movies which contain the given string in the title,and another array "unmatch" with all the remaining ones. 
      Ex. 20 Write a function called "removeIndex" which receives a number as a parameter and returns the movies array without the element in the given position.
